# Write a function, five_sort, that takes in a list of numbers as an argument. The function should rearrange elements of the list such that all 5s appear at the end. Your function should perform this operation in-place by mutating the original list. The function should return the list.

# Elements that are not 5 can appear in any order in the output, as long as all 5s are at the end of the list.

# test_00
# five_sort([12, 5, 1, 5, 12, 7])
# # -> [12, 7, 1, 12, 5, 5] 

def five_sort(nums):
  i = 0
  j = len(nums) - 1
  
  while i < j:
    if nums[j] == 5:
      j -= 1
    elif nums[i] == 5:
      nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
      i += 1
    else:
      i += 1
